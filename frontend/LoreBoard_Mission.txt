Help me develop a new platform, LoreBoard. It's an AI powered creative writing platform. The author writes their story in the web app text editor, and after they introduce a new entity (like a character, place, or item) they right click and hit Track Entity. When they do that, we take the nearby chunk of text, send it off to an LLM and have it register/initialize that entity and its attributes (attributes could be like physical attributes, personality/demeanor, relationships to other characters the database.) After that, whenever the user types that entity's name (or an alias they create for it), the same process with occur: nearby chunk of text is sent off to be interpreted by an LLM, where it stores key details about the entity and saves them. Then, when the author writes an entity that's already known in the database, they can hover to see aggregated details about it/them, without having to scroll up 300 pages.
It's essentially a smart writing environment that keeps track of story elements automatically, creating a dynamic knowledge base that helps authors maintain consistency without constant manual reference. it would keep track of all the details they create. As writers develop stories spanning hundreds of pages, it becomes increasingly difficult to remember every character trait, location detail, or thematic element they've established.
For the tech stack, we're thinking:
Frontend: React, next.js, TipTap for the text editor (might need an extension)
Backend: FastAPI (python), postgreSQL, openAI api for text digestion
I must note: WE ARE MAKING AN MVP RIGHT NOW! We are not going to make a full fledged platform with auth, cloud hosting and database, etc etc. Always be keeping in mind our MVP limitations. We are trying to get a demo up and running.
